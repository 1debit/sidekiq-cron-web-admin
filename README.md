# Sidekiq::Cron::Web::Admin

Removes the logic for enqueuing the workers on Cron, just keeps the web UI Admin and the funcionality for enqueuing the workers manually from the Admin.

This repository is a fork of https://github.com/ondrejbartas/sidekiq-cron where it overwrites the Poller class in charge of enqueuing the workers automatically;
it also overwrites the Launcher so it should not make any call to the Poller (https://github.com/1debit/sidekiq-cron-web-admin/tree/master/lib/sidekiq/cron).
